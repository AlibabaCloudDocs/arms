# Associated events

The associated event feature manages, stores, analyzes, and displays event data generated by cloud products, including K8s cluster events. When your application uses related products, the corresponding events are automatically connected to the associated events for unified analysis and display, which is convenient for you to view and analyze.

## Event model

An event associated with an event is mainly defined by the following parameters:

|Parameter|Required|Description|
|---------|--------|-----------|
|source|Yes|The source of an event.|
|type|Yes|The type of an event.|
|level|Yes|Event level|
|time|Yes|The time when the event occurs|
|data|Yes|Event body \(usually in JSON format\)|
|PID|No|Pod ID|
|IP|No|The IP addresses.|
|ClusterId|No|The ID of the cluster in Enterprise Distributed Application Service \(EDAS\).|
|PodName|No|Pod name|

## Go to the API Details page

1.  Log on to the [ARMS console](https://arms-ap-southeast-1.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Container Monitoring**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where your instance is located.

4.  Log on to the **Container monitoring**On the page that appears, click the name of the Kubernetes cluster.

5.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Associated events**.


## Associated Event Module Introduction

The associated events page is divided into non-application mode and application mode according to whether to enter an application interface. The former displays all events under the current account, while the latter displays only the events under the user that are related to the specified application.

Associated events mainly include typical events and four tabs \(respectively **Normal view**, **Topology view**, **Cluster view**and **Subscription rules**\).

-   Typical events: displays the number of typical events that are preset by the system. For more information, see [Typical events](#section_u4t_pgq_wzv).
-   **Normal view**A simple multi-dimensional analysis and display of all events associated with the current account. For more information, see [Normal view](#section_i60_ezh_5vh).
-   **Topology view**displays the events associated with the specified application and the resource topology diagram of the application. For more information, For information about how to solve this problem, [Topology view](#section_1d7_2bq_p90).
-   **Cluster view**A simple multi-dimensional analysis and display of all events associated with the current K8s cluster. For more information, For information about how to solve this problem, [Cluster view](#section_int_rox_pky).
-   **Subscription rules**The subscription rules that you have created are displayed in the form of a list. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_k3i_bqc_3z3).

## Typical events

Typical events: displays the number of times that a typical event type preset by the system occurs over a period of time \(the time range can be adjusted in the upper-right corner\). Click below the event **Subscription**, you can edit the subscription rules of the event. For operations on subscription rules, see [Subscription rules](#section_k3i_bqc_3z3).

## Normal view

**Normal view**You can search according to the search conditions you specify. The search results are displayed in four views: **heatmap of events in the last two weeks**, **Proportion of events from different sources**, **Trend of Number of Events from Different Sources**and **Event details**.

![Normal view](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8951117161/p170186.png)

-   **heatmap of events in the last two weeks**: displays the heat distribution by hour for the number of events that meet the filter conditions in the past two weeks. The darker color indicates more events in the hour.
-   **Proportion of events from different sources**: displays the proportion of events from different sources.
-   **Trend of Number of Events from Different Sources**: displays the trend of different source events in the selected period.
-   **Event details**: displays the details of all events.

**Normal view**View instructions:

-   Click **heatmap of events in the last two weeks**to view the event details in the hour.
-   Click **Trend of Number of Events from Different Sources The column in the**can be found in Event detailsarea to view all event list within the corresponding period.
-   Click Event detailson the right side **View**to view the specific content of the event.
-   Click Event detailson the right side **Subscription**to subscribe to a specified event. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_k3i_bqc_3z3).

## Topology view

The topology view first draws the resource topology of the specified application, including the ECS used by the application, the instance pod deployed by the application, all middleware resources such as RDS and Redis used by the application, and SLB and NAT mounted by the application. After that, the obtained associated events, ActionTrail, and Cloud Monitor events will be associated with the corresponding topology node. Click the corresponding node, and the **Event details**The region displays the events associated with the node:

-   **Application-side related events**: the event associated with the event.
-   **Cloud resource side related events**: the related event of the Cloud Monitor.
-   **Related ActionTrail**: That is, the audit record from the ActionTrail.

The topology view can help you troubleshoot the associated resources when an application error occurs. For example, in a large enterprise, an employee mistakenly restarts an ApsaraDB RDS instance in the production environment. This leads to an online service failure. The topology view helps you find out the restart operation on the ApsaraDB RDS instance that is accessed by the application.

## Cluster view

**Cluster view**You can search according to the search conditions you specify. The search results are displayed in four views: **Proportion of different cluster events**, **Trend of Number of Events in Different Clusters**, **Key Events at a Glance**, **Key resources at a glance**and **Event details**.

![Container Monitoring Associated Event Cluster View](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8269606261/p283054.png)

-   **Proportion of different cluster events**: displays the proportion of events in different clusters.
-   **Trend of Number of Events in Different Clusters**: displays the trend of different cluster events in the selected period.
