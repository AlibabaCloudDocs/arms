# QueryMetricByPage \(Browser Monitoring\)

Queries the metrics of Browser Monitoring.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=ARMS&api=QueryMetricByPage&type=RPC&version=2019-08-08)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|QueryMetricByPage|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to `QueryMetricByPage`. |
|EndTime|Long|Yes|1596183532000|The end of the time range to query. Unit: milliseconds. |
|IntervalInSec|Integer|Yes|60000|The time interval between the data shards to be queried. Unit: milliseconds. Minimum value: 60,000. |
|Measures.N|RepeatList|Yes|pv|The measurement data of the metric. For more information, see [Queryable Application Monitoring metrics](#section_2wv_zz8_zw7). You can add a maximum of five measurement data entries. |
|Metric|String|Yes|webstat.index|The metrics that you want to query. You cannot query custom metrics. For more information, see [Queryable Application Monitoring metrics](#section_2wv_zz8_zw7). |
|StartTime|Long|Yes|1595319532000|The beginning of the time range to query. Unit: milliseconds. |
|OrderBy|String|No|rpc|The measurement data entry by which metrics are sorted You can set this parameter to a type of measurement data. |
|Filters.N.Key|String|Yes|pid|The filtering condition for the query. The `pid` and `regionId` parameters are required. For information about how to obtain the `pid`, see [Obtain the PID of an application](#section_n8m_h9o_ebe). |
|Filters.N.Value|String|Yes|xxx@74xxx|The filtering condition for the query. The `pid` and `regionId` parameters are required. For information about how to obtain the `pid`, see [Obtain the PID of an application](#section_n8m_h9o_ebe). |
|Dimensions.N|RepeatList|No|\["detector\_browser","detector\_device"\]|The dimension by which metrics are queried. For more information, see [Queryable Application Monitoring metrics](#section_2wv_zz8_zw7). You can add a maximum of five measurement data entries. |
|Order|String|No|ASC|The measurement data entry by which metrics are sorted. Valid values:

-   `ASC`: ascending order
-   `DESC`: descending order |
|RegionId|String|No|cn-hangzhou|The ID of the region. |
|CurrentPage|Integer|No|1|The number of the page to return. Optional. Default value: `1`. |
|PageSize|Integer|No|10|The number of projects to return on each page. |

## Obtain the PID of an application

Log on to the Application Real-Time Monitoring Service console.In the left-side navigation pane, click **Browser Monitoring**. On the **Browser Monitoring**page, click the name of the application that you want to query to open the overview page of this application.

The URL in the browser address bar contains the pid of the frontend application in the format of `pid=xxx`. The browser is encoded. Therefore, you must modify the pid of all applications except for those in Enterprise Distributed Application Service \(EDAS\). For example, if the PID in the URL is `xxx%4074xxx`, you must replace `%40` with `@`. The PID is modified to `xxx@74xxx`.

## Response parameters

|Parameter|Type|Example|Description|
|---------|----|-------|-----------|
|Code|String|200|The status of the API. Valid values:

-   2XX: success
-   3XX: retried
-   4XX: request error
-   5XX: server error |
|Data|Struct|Â |The returned data struct. |
|Items|List|\[\]|The list of returned data structs. |
|Page|Integer|1|The page number of the returned page. |
|PageSize|Integer|10|The number of entries returned per page. |
|Total|Integer|0|The sum of queries. |
|Message|String|message|The returned message. |
|RequestId|String|626037F5-FDEB-45B0-804C-B3C92797\*\*\*\*|The ID of the request. |
|Success|Boolean|true|Indicates whether the query was successful. Valid values:

-   `true`: successful
-   `false`: failed |

## Queryable Application Monitoring metrics

You can call the QueryMetric operation to query the following metrics of Browser Monitoring.

**Note:**

-   You must specify `pid` and `regionId` in filters.
-   If you have obtained the values of the pid and regionId parameters, add the valueS to the filters parameter to define the range of query results. If you have not obtained the values of the pid and regionId parameters, pass the dimensions in the following table to the dimensions parameter to obtain a list of all possible values.
