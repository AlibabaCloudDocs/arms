# Create a contact group

When you create an alert rule, you can specify a contact group as the receiver of alert notifications. If the alert rule is triggered, Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) sends alert notifications to the contacts in the contact group. This topic describes how to create a contact group.

. For more information, see [Create contacts](/intl.en-US/Dashboard and alerting/Create contacts.md).

## Procedure

1.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Alerts** \> **Contacts**.

2.  On the Contact Group tab, click **Create a contact group** in the upper-right corner.

3.  In the Create a contact group dialog box, enter a group name in the **Group Name** field, select alert contacts in the **Alarm contact** list, and then click **OK**.

    **Note:** If no alert contacts are displayed in the **Alarm contact** list, you must first create an alert contact. For more information, see [Create contacts](/intl.en-US/Dashboard and alerting/Create contacts.md).


## What to do next



-   To search for a contact group, go to the Contact Group tab, enter the contact group name or keywords of the name in the search box, and then click the icon.

    **Note:** The search is case-sensitive.

    **Note:** You can remove one or more contacts from a contact group in shown mode. To remove a contact, find the alert contact and click **Remove** in the **Operation** column.

-   To delete a contact group, click the ![delete_01](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7573758061/p181706.png) icon to the right of the contact group. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

    **Note:** Before you delete a contact group, make sure that no monitoring tasks to which the contact group is attached are running. Otherwise, the alerting feature cannot function as expected.
