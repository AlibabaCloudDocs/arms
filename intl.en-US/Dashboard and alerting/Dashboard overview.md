# Dashboard overview

This topic introduces the user interface of Dashboards.

In the left-side navigation pane of the console, click **Dashboards**. On the Dashboards page, you can find all dashboards.

A dashboard consists of the control operation area, tab operation area, navigation tree operation area, and dataset presentation area. The following figure shows a complete dashboard.

-   \[A\] control operation area: You can add controls, such as a navigation tree, charts, and texts, and specify the time range.

-   \[B\] tab operation area: You can add different tabs to group charts. For example, to show statistics of page views \(PV\) and unique visitors \(UV\) of NGINX pages, and also the statistics of error codes on these pages, you can use two separate tabs.

-   \[C\] navigation tree operation area: You can set a navigation tree that has up to three levels. Drill down level by level and click a query dimension to view the relevant data in the right-side dataset presentation module. The navigation tree is automatically generated by ARMS based on user data, or manually imported in JSON format.

-   \[D\] dataset presentation area: The core module of the dashboard. In this area, all data charts under different tabs are displayed based on the selected navigation tree dimension and time range, and multiple tabs can be added.
