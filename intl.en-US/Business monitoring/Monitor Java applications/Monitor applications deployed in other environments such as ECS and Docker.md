# Monitor applications deployed in other environments such as ECS and Docker

The business transaction feature provided by Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) allows you to define business requests in a visualized manner by using non-intrusive methods and provides abundant business-specific performance metrics and diagnostic capabilities. Before you use the business transaction feature, you must install or upgrade the ARMS agent for Java applications.

## Limits

-   The business transaction feature can only monitor Java applications.
-   Only the ARMS agent V2.6.2 or later supports the business transaction feature.

## Install or upgrade the ARMS agent for Java applications deployed on ECS instances

1.  If you are using the business transaction feature for the first time and have not used the application monitoring feature, you must install the latest version of the ARMS agent.

    For more information, see [Manually install the ARMS agent for a Java application](/intl.en-US/Application monitoring/Quick start/Monitor Java applications/Manually install the ARMS agent for a Java application.md).

2.  If you are using the business transaction feature for the first time and have used the application monitoring feature, you must upgrade the ARMS agent to V2.6.2 or later.

    1.  To upgrade the ARMS agent, you must uninstall the existing ARMS agent and install a new one.

        For more information, see [Uninstall the ARMS agent](/intl.en-US/Application monitoring/Quick start/Monitor Java applications/Manually install the ARMS agent for a Java application.md).

    2.  Install a new ARMS agent.
