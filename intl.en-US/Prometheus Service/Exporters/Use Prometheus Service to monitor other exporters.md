# Use Prometheus Service to monitor other exporters

Alibaba Cloud Prometheus Service allows you to install and configure exporters of the database type, message type, HTTP server type, and other types. The service also provides out-of-the-box dashboards.

## Add exporters of other types

Prometheus Service will support quick access to other types of exporters soon. If your exporter is not supported, install the exporter, configure service discovery, and then create a dashboard. For more information, see [Use Prometheus Service to monitor MySQL data]().

For more information about the Prometheus exporters, see [Exporters and integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/).
