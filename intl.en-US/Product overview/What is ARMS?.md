## Application Monitoring

ARMS Application Monitoring is an application performance management \(APM\) service. To monitor an application, you only need to install the ARMS agent. You do not need to modify the code of the application. The ARMS agent helps you identify abnormal and slow API operations, view request parameters, and detect system bottlenecks. This improves the efficiency of online troubleshooting.
