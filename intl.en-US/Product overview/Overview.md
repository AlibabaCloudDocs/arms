-   Job definition:
    -   ARMS allows you to define jobs such as real-time processing, data storage, presentation and analysis, data API, and alerts through job configuration, to define your own application scenarios.
    -   ARMS directly performs business monitoring with preset scenarios, such as browser monitoring and application monitoring.
-   Application scenario: In addition to custom monitoring, ARMS also provides ready-to-use preset monitoring scenarios, including browser monitoring and application monitoring.
