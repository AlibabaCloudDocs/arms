## Success rate of API calls

The Success Rate tab on the left ranks the success rates of API calls. The API Success Rate section on the right shows the curve of the call volume and call success rate of the API selected on the left within a specified time range. The API Link Trace \(TOP 20\) section on the right shows the traces of the top 20 failed and successful calls to the API. You can click **Link Trace** and **View Details** in the **Actions** column to check the trace and view details.
