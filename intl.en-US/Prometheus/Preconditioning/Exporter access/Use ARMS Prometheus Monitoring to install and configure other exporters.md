# Use ARMS Prometheus Monitoring to install and configure other exporters

Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) Prometheus Monitoring enables you to install and configure exporters of the database, messaging system, and HTTP server types, and provides out-of-the-box dashboards.

## Add exporters of other types

ARMS will support quick access to other types of exporters soon. If your exporter is not supported, manually install the exporter, configure service discovery, and then create a dashboard. For more information, see [Manually access ARMS Prometheus Monitoring to monitor MySQL data]().

For more information about the Prometheus exporters, see [Exporters and integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/).
