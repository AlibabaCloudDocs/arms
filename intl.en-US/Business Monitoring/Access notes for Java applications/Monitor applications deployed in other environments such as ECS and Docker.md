# Monitor applications deployed in other environments such as ECS and Docker

The business transaction feature provided by ARMS allows you to define business requests in a visualized manner by using non-intrusive methods and provides abundant business-specific performance metrics and diagnostic capabilities. Before you use the business transaction feature, you must install or upgrade the ARMS agent for Java applications.

## Limits

-   The business transaction feature only can monitor Java applications.
-   Only the ARMS agent V2.6.2 or later supports the business transaction feature.
