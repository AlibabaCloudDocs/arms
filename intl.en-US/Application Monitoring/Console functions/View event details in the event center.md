# View event details in the event center

The event center is a feature module that centralizes, stores, analyzes, and shows event data generated by some cloud services. The event center supports the following event sources: change events of Enterprise Distributed Application Service \(EDAS\), alert events of Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\), 0-1 status events, such as deadlocks, out of memory \(OOM\), and application startup failures, microservice governance events of Microservice Engine \(MSE\), and Kubernetes cluster events. If your application uses one of the related services, the event center automatically analyzes and displays the corresponding events in a unified manner. This provides an easy way for you to view and analyze the events.

## Event model

An event in the event center is defined by the following five parameters: `source, type, level, time, and data`. Typically, the data parameter is a JSON string. When you search for, demonstrate, and subscribe to events, the five parameters are used.

Some optional parameters, such as PID, IP, ClusterId, and PodName, can also be associated with an event.

## Go to the event center

1.  Log on to the [ARMS console](https://arms-ap-southeast-1.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Monitoring** \> **Applications**. In the top navigation bar, select the region where your application is located, and then click the application name.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Event Center**.


## Overview of the event center module

The Event Center page appears in non-application mode or application mode, based on whether an application page is opened. The non-application mode displays all events of the account, whereas the application mode displays only the events that are related to a specified application of the account.

The Event Center page consists of typical events and the **Normal View**, **Topology View**, and **Subscription rules** tabs.

-   Typical events: displays the number of typical events that are preset by the system. For more information, see [Typical events](#section_1wn_yng_nw3).
-   On the **Normal View** tab, all events associated with the current application are analyzed and displayed in multiple dimensions. For more information, see [Normal view](#section_9xe_ve1_apw).
-   On the **Topology View** tab, the events associated with the application and the resource topology of the application are displayed together. For more information, see [Topology view](#section_or4_auc_c2u).
-   On the **Subscription rules** tab, subscription rules that you create are displayed in a list. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_qg6_2r4_452).

## Typical events

Typical events: displays the number of times that each type of typical event preset by the system occurred within the last 30 minutes. You can adjust the time range in the upper-right corner. Click **Subscribe** below an event to edit subscription rules of the event. For more information about subscription rules, see [Subscription rules](#section_qg6_2r4_452).

## Normal view

On the **Normal View** tab, you can specify filter conditions to search for events. The search results are displayed in four views: **Heat map of events in last two weeks**, **Proportion of events from different sources**, **Trend of the number of events from different sources**, and **Event Details**.

![Normal view](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8951117161/p170186.png)

-   The **Heat map of events in last two weeks** section shows the heat map for hourly occurrences of events that meet the filter conditions in the last two weeks. The darker color indicates more events in the hour.
-   The **Proportion of events from different sources** section displays the proportions of events from different sources.
-   The **Trend of the number of events from different sources** section displays the trends of events from different sources within a specified period.
-   The **Event Details** section displays details about all current events.

Perform the following steps to view information on the **Normal View** tab:

-   In the **Heat map of events in last two weeks** section, click each heat block to view event details in the hour.
-   In the **Trend of the number of events from different sources** section, click each column to view all the events that occurred in the corresponding period in the Event Details section.
-   In the Event Details section, click **View** on the right side of an event to view details of the event.
-   In the Event Details section, click **Subscription** on the right side of an event to subscribe to the event. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_qg6_2r4_452).

## Topology view

On the Topology View tab, the resource topology of the application is displayed. The resources include the Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances used by the application, pods on which the application is running, the ApsaraDB RDS and ApsaraDB for Redis middleware used by the application, and the Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) and NAT Gateway resources mounted to the application. After the resource topology is displayed, the obtained correlated events, ActionTrail events, and Cloud Monitor events are associated with topology nodes. If you click a node, the events associated with the node are displayed in the **Event Details** section in the upper-left corner.

-   **Application-side events**: the events in the event center.
-   **Events related to cloud resources**: the events that are related to Cloud Monitor.
-   **Audit related operations**: the audit records from ActionTrail.

The topology view can help you troubleshoot the associated resources when an application error occurs. For example, in a large enterprise, an employee mistakenly restarts an ApsaraDB RDS instance in the production environment. This leads to an online service failure. The topology view helps you find out the restart operation on the ApsaraDB RDS instance that is accessed by the application.

## Subscription rules

On the Subscription rules tab, all your existing subscription rules are displayed. You can enable, disable, or modify subscription rules on this tab.

**Note:** You can modify only the rules that you create in the console. You cannot modify the rules that are automatically created by the system.

A subscription rule is used as a basis for you to subscribe to events that meet specified criteria and send the events to a specified webhook URL. You can use one of the following methods to create a subscription rule:

-   Method 1: On the Subscription rules tab, click **Create a subscription rule** in the upper-right corner.
-   Method 2: On the **Normal View** tab, click **Subscription** in the Operation column of an event in the Event Details section.



1.  Click the **Subscription rules** tab. On this tab, click **Create a subscription rule** in the upper-right corner.

2.  In the **Create a subscription rule** panel, set **Rule name** and **Rule description**, and then click **Next** in the **Enter basic information** step.

3.  In the **Select event mode** step, set the event rule parameters and click **Next**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**Event Source**|Select an event source from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Type**|Select an event type from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Level**|Select an event level from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Keywords**|Enter an event keyword in the field.|
    |**Show advanced filtering options**|By default, this feature is disabled. After you enable this feature, you can configure filtering options, such as **Cluster ID**, **Interface/service name**, **Host IP**, and **POD name**.|
    |**Custom filter conditions**|A custom filter condition is used to specify the condition that must be met by a field in the JSON data of the event body. The root node of a custom filter condition is data. The root node drills down to a field in the JSON data in the format of `.`. Enter custom filter conditions. You can enter up to six filter conditions.|
    |**Select a valid field**|Enter a valid field in the format of `%data.x.y;`. Then, enter an alias for the field. The alias can be used as a placeholder when you enter the POST request body of webhook information. You can set up to six valid fields.|
    |**Notification Template**|In the Notification Template field, enter the content that will be notified to you when the specified message occurs. If the notification object is a DingTalk chatbot webhook, include the keyword used to create the DingTalk chatbot in the notification template. |

4.  From the **Select Contact** drop-down list, select a contact. Then, click **Submitted**.

    If no contact is available in the **Select Contact** drop-down list, click **Create Contact** on the right side to create a contact. After you create it, select it from the Select Contact drop-down list.
