# Monitor applications other than Java and PHP applications

Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) can monitor Java and PHP applications.To monitor applications written in other programming languages, such as C++, Go, Node.js, and .NET, you can use Tracing Analysis. Tracing Analysis can be used to aggregate requests and generate traces, collect application performance data in real time, and dynamically discover distributed topologies. These features help you monitor your applications.

## Background information

Tracing Analysis helps you analyze and diagnose performance bottlenecks in a distributed application architecture with efficiency and makes microservice development and diagnostics more efficient. Tracing Analysis provides the following features:

-   Aggregation of requests and generation of traces: Tracing Analysis collects all user requests of microservices in a distributed architecture and summarizes these requests to distributed traces.
-   Real-time collection of application performance data: Tracing Analysis collects all user requests for an application and analyzes in real time the performance of the services and resources that constitute the application.
-   Dynamic discovery of distributed topologies: Tracing Analysis collects information about distributed calls to your distributed microservice applications and Platform as a Service \(PaaS\) products.
-   Compatibility with open source communities: Tracing Analysis is compatible with open source communities such as Jaeger and Zipkin based on the OpenTracing standard.
-   Integration with downstream services: Tracing Analysis provides traces that are immediately usable to Alibaba Cloud Log Service. Tracing Analysis can send the traces to downstream analysis platforms such as MaxCompute.
