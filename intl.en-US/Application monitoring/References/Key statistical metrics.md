# Key statistical metrics

This topic describes the meanings of key statistical metrics on each page in application monitoring of Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\).

## Terms

The following terms are used in this topic:

-   Apdex

    [Application Performance Index \(Apdex\)](http://www.apdex.org/) is an internationally accepted standard for evaluating application performance. In Apdex, the user experience of an application can be classified into three levels:

    -   Satisfied \(0 to T\)
    -   Tolerating \(T to 4T\)
    -   Frustrated \(greater than 4T\)

    Image source: [apdex.org](http://www.apdex.org/images/overview_figure1_performancezones_256_111.gif)

    The following formula is used to calculate the Apdex score:

    ```
    Apdex = (Satisfied samples + Tolerating samples/2)/Total samples
    ```

    ARMS uses the average response time of an application in calculation, and defines T at 500 ms.

-   instance

    An instance is a machine where the monitored application is deployed. The granularity of an instance is JVM. In the following figure, "a3" is an application, and each row under a3 is a machine where a3 is deployed. Each machine is an instance.

## Statistics pages

-   Applications

    In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Monitoring** \> **Applications** to view the health rate, requests, errors, response time, exceptions, status, and response time in the last ten minutes of instances.

-   Application Overview

    On the Applications page, click the name of an application to go to the Application Overview page. You can select menus in the upper part of the page to view statistics in other dimensions.

    -   Overview Analysis
        -   Services provided by the application: requests and average response time
        -   Services the application depends on: requests, average response time, the number of instances, and HTTP status code
        -   System information: CPU, memory, and load
        -   Statistical analysis: slow call analysis, average response time, exception type, and times of occurrence
    -   Topology Graph
        -   Application topology
        -   Instance health status: Green indicates Normal, yellow indicates Alerting, and red indicates Severe.
        -   Type of call:

            |Type of call|Description|Remarks|
            |:-----------|:----------|:------|
            |Local API call|Local API operation calls|API operation call|
            |HTTP entry point|The entry point of the application called by the client by using HTTP|Service entry call|
            |Dubbo call|Calls generated by Dubbo consumers|Service entry call|
            |HSF call|Calls generated by HSF consumers|Service entry call|
            |HTTP call|HTTP calls initiated by this application to other services|Inter-service call|
            |HSF provision|Calls generated by HSF providers|Inter-service call|
            |Dubbo provision|Calls generated by Dubbo providers|Inter-service call|
            |MySQL call|Calls initiated for operating on MySQL|Database call|
            |Oracle call|Calls initiated for operating on Oracle|Database call|
            |Redis call|Calls initiated for operating on Redis|Database call|

        -   Instance IP: The IP addresses of all instances where the application is deployed.
        -   The number of requests per minute, the response time, and the error rate of the application.
    -   3D Topology
        -   QPS: the queries per second
        -   RT\(ms\): the response time in milliseconds
        -   ErrQps: the error queries per second
-   Application Details

    This page shows details of calling the current application. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of different dimensions, such as instance response time, the number of requests, the number of errors, instance overview, SQL analysis, exception analysis, and interface snapshot.

-   Interface Invocation

    This page shows the statistical information of API operations provided by the current application. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of different dimensions, such as instance response time, the number of requests, the number of errors, instance overview, SQL analysis, exception analysis, and interface snapshot.

-   Database Invocation

    This page shows application-related database invocation information. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of different dimensions, such as instance response time, the number of requests, the number of errors, instance overview, SQL analysis, and exception analysis.


## Key statistical metrics on related tabs

-   Response Time: The average response time of applications and instance calls, or the average execution response time of database operations
-   Requests: The number of requests to call applications or instances, or the number of times database operations are performed
-   Errors: The number of incorrect application or instance calls, or the number of abnormal executions in database operations
-   Overview

    |Reported field|Description|
    |:-------------|:----------|
    |Requests|The number of requests to call applications or instances, or the number of times database operations are performed|
    |Response Time|The average response time of applications and instance calls, or the average execution response time of database operations|
