# Key statistical metrics

This topic explains the meanings of key statistical metrics on each page in application monitoring of Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\).

## Terms

Here are the basic terms for this topic:

-   Apdex

    [Application Performance Index \(Apdex\)](http://www.apdex.org/) is an internationally accepted standard for evaluating application performance. According to Apdex, the user experience of an application is defined at three levels:

    -   - Satisfied \(0 to T\)
    -   - Tolerating \(T to 4T\)
    -   - Frustrated \(greater than 4T\)

    The following formula is used to calculate the Apdex score::

    ```
    Apdex score = (Satisfied samples + Tolerating samples/2)/Total samples
    ```

    ARMS uses the average response time of an application in calculation, and defines T at 500 ms.

-   Instances

    An instance is a machine where the monitored application is deployed. The granularity of an instance is JVM.


## Related statistics pages

-   The Application Monitoring \> Applications page

    In the left-side navigation pane of the console, choose **Application Monitoring** \> **Applications**. You can view the Apdex satisfaction trend curve of each application.

-   The Application Overview page

    On the Applications page, click the name of the target application to access the Application Overview page. Choose the corresponding menus in the left-side navigation pane. Then you can view statistics for other dimensions on other pages.

    -   Overview Analysis

        -   Services provided by the application: requests and average response time
        -   Services the application depends on: requests and average response time
        -   System information: CPU, memory, and load
        -   Statistical analysis: slow call analysis, average response time, exception type, and times of occurrence
    -   Topology tab

        -   Application topology
        -   Instance health status: Green indicates Normal, yellow indicates Alerting, and red indicates Severe.
        -   Type of call:

            |Type of call|Description|Remarks|
            |:-----------|:----------|:------|
            |HTTP entry point|The client uses the HTTP protocol to call the entry point of the application|Service entry call|

            |HSF calls|Calls generated by HSF consumers|Service entry call|
            |HTTP call|HTTP call initiated by this application to other services|Inter-service calls|
            |HSF provision|Calls generated by HSF producers|Inter-service calls|
            |Dubbo provision|Calls generated by Dubbo producers|Inter-service calls|

            |Oracle call|Calls initiated for operating on Oracle|Database call|
            |Redis call|Calls initiated for operating on Redis|Database call|

-   Application Details page

    This page shows details of calling the current application. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of different dimensions, such as instance response time, request count, error count, instance overview, SQL analysis, exception analysis, and interface snapshot.

-   API call page

    This page shows the statistical information of APIs opened by the current application. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of different dimensions, such as instance response time, request count, error count, instance overview, SQL analysis, exception analysis, and interface snapshot.

-   Database call page

    This page shows application-related database call information. Click different tabs to view the detailed analysis of instance response time, request count, error count, instance overview, SQL analysis, or exception analysis.
