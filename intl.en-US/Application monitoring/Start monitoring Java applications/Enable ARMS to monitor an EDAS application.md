# Enable ARMS to monitor an EDAS application

You can use Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) to monitor applications that are deployed in Enterprise Distributed Application Service \(EDAS\). ARMS allows you to monitor applications based on various performance metrics, such as topology, API requests, abnormal transactions, slow transactions, and SQL analysis. To enable ARMS to monitor an EDAS application, you only need to perform a few operations in the EDAS console.

## Prerequisites

## Enable ARMS to monitor an application in the EDAS console

1.  Log on to the [EDAS console](https://edas-intl.console.aliyun.com).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Management** \> **Applications**.
3.  On the Applications page, select a region in the top navigation bar and click the name of the application to be monitored by ARMS.
4.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Monitoring** \> **Advanced Monitoring** or **Monitoring** \> **Advanced Monitoring**. Then, click **Enable Advanced Application Monitoring**.
5.  In the Confirm dialog box, click **Confirm**.

## View the monitoring data of the EDAS application in ARMS

After you enable ARMS to monitor the application, click **Go to ARMS Application Monitoring**. The **Applications** page of the ARMS console appears. On the Applications page, click the name of the application to view the detailed monitoring data.

After you enable ARMS to monitor the EDAS application, you can use multiple application monitoring capabilities, as shown in the following examples.
