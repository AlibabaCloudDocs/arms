# View event details in the event center

The event center is the feature module that centralizes, stores, analyzes, and shows the event data generated by some cloud services. The event center can manage the change events of Enterprise Distributed Application Service \(EDAS\), alert events of Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\), 0-1 events such as deadlock, out-of-memory \(OOM\), and application startup, microservice management events of Microservice Engine \(MSE\), and Kubernetes cluster events. If your application uses one of the related services, the events under the services can be managed by the event center for easy view and analysis.

## Event model

An event in the event center is defined by the following five parameters: `source, type, level, time, and data`. Typically, the data parameter is a JSON string. When you search for, demonstrate, and subscribe to events, the five parameters are used.

Some optional parameters such as PID, IP, ClusterId, and PodName can also be associated with an event.

## Go to the event center

1.  Log on to the [ARMS console](https://arms-ap-southeast-1.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Application Monitoring** \> **Applications**. In the top navigation bar, select a region and then click the application name.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Event Center**.


## Features

The Event Overview page consists of three major tabs: **Normal View**, **Topology View**, and **Subscription rules**.

-   On the **Normal View** tab, all events associated with the current application are displayed and analyzed in multiple dimensions. For more information, see [.](#section_9xe_ve1_apw)
-   On the **Topology View** tab, the events associated with the current application and the resource topology of the application are displayed together. For more information, see [.](#section_or4_auc_c2u)
-   On the **Subscription rules** tab, created subscription rules are displayed as a list. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_qg6_2r4_452).

## Normal View

On the **Normal View** tab, you can specify filter conditions to search for events. The search results are displayed in three views: **Proportion of events from different sources**, **Trend of the number of events from different sources**, and **Event Details**.

![Normal view](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5940758061/p170186.png)

-   If you click a bar of a point in time in the bar chart, a list of the events associated with the point in time is shown in the Event Details section.
-   To view the details of an event, click **View** on the right side of the Event Details section.
-   To subscribe to an event, click **Subscribe** on the right side of the Event Details section. For more information, see [Subscription rules](#section_qg6_2r4_452).

## Topology View

On the Topology View tab, the resource topology of the application is displayed. The resources include the ECS instances used by the application, pod instances deployed on the application, the RDS and Redis middleware that are used by the application, as well as the SLB and NAT resources mounted to the application. After the resource topology is displayed, the obtained correlated events, ActionTrail events, and Cloud Monitor events are associated with topology nodes. If you click a node, the events associated with the node are displayed in the **Event Details** section in the upper-left corner.

-   **Application-side events**: events in the event center
-   **Events related to cloud resources**: the events that are related to Cloud Monitor
-   **Audit related operations**: the audit records from ActionTrail

Topology Views can help you to troubleshoot the associated resources when an application error occurs. For example, in a large enterprise, an employee mistakenly restarts an ApsaraDB RDS instance in the production environment, which leads to an online service failure. Topology View helps you to find out the restart operation on the ApsaraDB RDS instance that is accessed by the application.

## Subscription rules

On the Subscription rules tab, all your subscription rules are displayed. You can enable, disable, or modify subscription rules on this page.

**Note:** You can modify only the rules that you created in the console. You cannot modify rules that are automatically created by the system.

A subscription rule is used as a basis when you subscribe to events that meet specified criteria and send the events to a specified webhook. You can use one of the following methods to create a subscription rule:

-   Method 1: On the Subscription rules tab, click **Create a subscription rule** in the upper-right corner.
-   Method 2: On the **Normal View** tab, click **Subscribe** in the Operation column of the event in the Event Details section.



1.  Click the **Subscription rules** tab and then click **Create a subscription rule** in the upper-right corner of the page.

2.  In the **Enter basic information** step of the **Create a subscription rule** panel, enter values in the **Rule name** and **Rule description** fields and then click **Next**.

3.  After you select an event mode, click **Next**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**Event Source**|Select an event source from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Type**|Select an event type from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Level**|Select an event level from the drop-down list.|
    |**Event Keywords**|Enter an event keyword in the field.|
    |**Show advanced filtering options**|By default, this feature is disabled. If you enable this feature, you can configure the filter conditions such as **Cluster ID**, **Interface/service name**, **Host IP**, and **POD name**.|
    |**Custom filter conditions**|A custom filter condition is used to specify the condition that must be met by a field of the JSON data. The root node of a custom filter condition is data. The root node drills down to a field of the JSON data in the form of `.` Enter custom filter conditions. You can enter up to six filter conditions.|
    |**Select a valid field**|Enter a valid field in the form of `%data.x.y;`. Then, enter an alias for the field. The alias can be used as a placeholder when you fill in the POST request body of webhook information. You can set up to six valid fields.|

4.  Enter webhook information and click **Submitted**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**http method**|The GET and POST methods are supported. If you select GET, you must enter values for the url path andInput path/header parameters fields. If you select POST, you must also specify the Body field.|
    |**url path**|Enter a URL.|
    |**Input path/header parameters**|Header is the request header parameter that is generally specified in the form of content-type. Param is the path parameter, which is suffixed to the entered URL in the form of `?key1=value1&key2=value2`.|
    |**Body**|You can use the \{key\} placeholder in the Body string. The key can be the field alias selected in the [3](#step_xrv_73y_c5f) step, and pre-defined fields such as source \(event source\), type \(event type\), data \(event data body\), timeStr \(time\), clusterId \(cluster ID\), pid \(application ID\), ip \(IP address\), and level \(event level\).**Note:** The Param parameter setting does not take effect in the POST request. If this parameter must be reflected in the POST request, this parameter must be suffixed to the entered URL. |


1.  In the **Event Details** section of the **Normal View** tab, click **Subscribe** in the Operation column of the event.

    If you create a subscription rule by using this method, the source, type, and level filter conditions are automatically selected based on the selected event.

2.  Enter a value in the Value field in the JSON file of the event. This way, you can specify custom filter conditions and valid fields. A filter condition and a selection field are automatically selected each time you enter a value. You can manually modify or delete the fields to adjust the subscription rule. After you set an event mode, click **Next**.
