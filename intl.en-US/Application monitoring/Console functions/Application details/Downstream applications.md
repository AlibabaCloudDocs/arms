# Downstream applications

A downstream application of a specific application is an application that receives data from the specific application. This topic shows you how to view the information about downstream applications, including the response time, number of requests, and number of errors.

The Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) agent is installed for an application. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Application monitoring/Quick start/Overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [ARMS console](https://arms-ap-southeast-1.console.aliyun.com/#/home).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, Select **Application monitoring** \> **Applications**.

3.  In the top navigation bar of the MNS console, select the region where your cluster is deployed.

4.  Log on to the **Applications**Page, click the application name.

5.  Log on to the **Left-side navigation pane**Place place your cursor over the vertical dots next to **Application details**.

6.  On the **Application Details** page, select an instance where the application is deployed, set the time period, and then click the **Downstream applications** tab.

## Response time

The **Response Time** section displays the time series curve that indicates the response time of the downstream applications of the application in the specified time period.

1.  In the **Response Time** section, perform the following operations as required:

    -   Move the cursor over the statistics chart to view the statistics.
    -   Select a period of time to view the statistics for the specified period.

## Number of requests

The **Requests** section displays the time series curve that indicates the number of requests of the downstream applications of the application in the specified time period.
