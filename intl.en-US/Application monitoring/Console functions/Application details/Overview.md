# Overview

This topic shows you how to obtain an overview of an application. On the Overview tab of the application, you can view the application topology, number of requests, response time, number of errors, and HTTP status codes.

The Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) agent is installed for an application. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Application monitoring/Quick start/Overview.md).

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [ARMS console](https://arms-ap-southeast-1.console.aliyun.com/#/home).
