# Crash metrics

The crash analysis feature of App Monitoring allows you to view crash data and troubleshoot issues based on crash metrics.

## Crash metrics for Android

|Crash metric|Description|Formula|
|------------|-----------|-------|
|Overall Crash Rate|A basic crash metric that consists of Native Crash Rate and Java Crash Rate.|Overall Crash Rate = Number of crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|Native Crash Rate|A basic crash metric that indicates the rate of native crashes.|Native Crash Rate = Number of native crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|User Rate of Native Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the user rate of native crashes.|User Rate of Native Crashes = Number of different devices affected by native crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of UVs|
|Native Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the number of native crashes.|Native Crashes = Number of native crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|Java Crash Rate|A basic metric that indicates the rate of Java crashes.|Java Crash Rate = Number of Java crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|User Rate of Java Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the user rate of Java crashes.|User Rate of Java Crashes = Number of devices affected by Java crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of UVs|
|Java Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the number of Java crashes.|Java Crashes = Number of Java crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|

## Crash metrics for iOS

|Crash metric|Description|Formula|
|------------|-----------|-------|
|Overall Crash Rate|A basic crash metric that consists of Full-stack Crash Rate and Abort Crash Rate.|Overall Crash Rate = Number of crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|Full-stack Crash Rate|A basic metric that indicates the rate of full-stack crashes.|Full-stack Crash Rate = Number of full-stack crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|User Rate of Full-stack Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the user rate of full-stack crashes.|User Rate of Full-stack Crashes = Number of devices affected by full-stack crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of UVs|
|Full-stack Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the number of full-stack crashes.|Full-stack Crashes = Number of full-stack crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|Abort Crash Rate|A basic metric that indicates the rate of Abort crashes.|Abort Crash Rate = Number of Abort crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of application startups between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
|User Rate of Abort Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the user rate of Abort crashes.|User Rate of Abort Crashes = Number of devices affected by Abort crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time / Number of UVs|
|Abort Crashes|A basic metric that indicates the number of Abort crashes.|Abort Crashes = Number of Abort crashes that occur between 00:00:00 \(UTC+8\) on the current day and the current time|
